# CovidPortfolioProject
The main goals of this project are to use SQL Server to explore data about Covid-19 
and use Power BI Desktop to build a visual, summarizing all the insights and figures about it.

The data we used was obtained on https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and accessed on 18/04/2022. 
This dataset shows information about deaths and vaccinations of Covid-19 from the beginning of the pandemic until 04/17/2022.
